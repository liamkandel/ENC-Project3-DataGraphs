# ENC-Project3-DataGraphs
This is a part of Project 3 in my ENC class where we remediate a genre of our choice.
I wanted to represent algorithmic bias by writing a Python script that generates 500
applicants who are given a random set of the following features:

Race, Gender, Age, Birth Region, Education 

Based on their features, each applicants salary was altered in a way to show bias. 
I plotted the data using Seaborn:
